   <h2>Samanta Y. Baez Gomez</h2>
   <p>Hello everyone! My name is Samanta. I'm  18 years old and I am from Mexico. Three years ago, I moved to Quebec Canada 
    with my family, so I learned to speak French. I also lived in the US several years when I was younger. With 
    Spanish being my first language, I learned English too. I love to sing, dance, play instruments and bake.</p>
    <p>I would like to get a Bachelor's Degree in Web Design and Development in BYUI. I am excited to learn new
    things and to make new abilities in this first semester. I wish you the best to every one of you and lots of success.
    Thank you for visiting my web page.</p>
